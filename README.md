# showMyCar
Displays selectable manufacturers with car types and built dates and summarizes selected manufacturer.

This project is written in Kotlin, MVVM, data binding, Dagger2, RxJava, EventBus, Retrofit. I used Android Studio 3.0 Canary 8 for compilation. Please use at least this
version.

To run the test cases you need to configure your android studio as follows:

Go to Run menu, Run/Debug, select default, Android JUnit.
“Working directory” should be set to $MODULE_DIR$


About improvements I would be happy. Perhaps you will send me a pull request?
