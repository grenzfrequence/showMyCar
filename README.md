# showMyCar
Displays selectable manufacturers with car types and built dates and summarizes selected manufacturer. Written in Kotlin.

This project is written in MVVM, data binding. I used Android Studio 3.0 Canary 8 for compilation. Please use at least this
version.

About improvements I would be happy. Perhaps you will send me a pull request?
