# showMyCar
Displays selectable manufacturers with car types and built dates and summarizes selected manufacturer.

This project is written in Kotlin, MVVM, data binding, Dagger2, RxJava, EventBus, Retrofit. I used Android Studio 3.0 Beta 2 for compilation. Please use this
version to avoid backwards compatable bugs of android studio.

To run the test cases you need to configure your android studio as follows:

Go to Run menu, Edit Configurations..., select default, Android JUnit.
“Working directory” should be set to $MODULE_DIR$


About improvements I would be happy. Perhaps you will send me a pull request?
